# eTran-Only Performance Metrics & Reproduction Targets (NSDI '25)

This document contains **ONLY** the performance metrics, benchmarks, and target values involving **eTran** (eTran - Homa, eTran - TCP, and eTran hooks/pacing configurations). Baselines and comparison stacks (Linux TCP/Homa, TAS) have been excluded.

An empty column/cell has been provided in each table for you to record your own measured values during reproduction.

## 3. eTran Internal Data Path Microbenchmarks (Hooks and Maps Performance)

### 3.1 XDP_EGRESS Hook Performance (Table 3)

### 3.2 XDP_GEN Hook Packet Generation Performance (Table 4)

## 4. Minimum Required Physical Machines for Reproduction

To successfully reproduce the performance benchmarks presented in the paper, ensure you have the appropriate number of dedicated physical servers (ideally equipped with 25 Gbps ConnectX-4 NICs and connected to a 25 Gbps switch):

* **Single-Stream Microbenchmarks (Median Latency, 1MB Large Throughput, CPU Cycle Breakdown, and eBPF Hook Performance)**:
  * **Minimum required**: **2 Physical Machines** (1 Server, 1 Client).
* **Multi-threaded Key-Value Store Workloads (Zipf KV Workload)**:
  * **Minimum required**: **6 Physical Machines** (1 Server, 5 Clients) - to reproduce the 6K persistent connections from 5 client machines.
* **Concurrent Multi-threaded Client / Server Throughput**:
  * **Minimum required**: **8 Physical Machines** (1 Server and 7 Clients to issue concurrent RPCs, or 1 Client and 7 Servers to sink concurrent RPCs).
* **Cluster Benchmarks (Homa workloads W2 to W5)**:
  * **Minimum required**: **10 Physical Machines** (All 10 nodes acting as both multi-threaded clients and servers concurrently).
